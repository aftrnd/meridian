// MARK: - Card ↔ Detail transition (iOS / tvOS app-open)
//
// Click a card: a rounded rect grows from the card to fill the detail column.
// Inside it the card art dissolves into the LIVE detail page, which is scaled
// to cover the rect and grows with it — the page is revealed *inside* the
// zoom, never after it. Behind, the library recedes (scales down + fades)
// exactly like the iOS home screen. Close is the same motion in reverse, and
// either direction can be reversed mid-flight (click Back while still
// opening) because everything is driven by ONE animatable `progress`.
//
// Structure (see ContentView.stage): the detail column is a ZStack that keeps
// the root page mounted at all times (state — scroll offsets, search text,
// carousel index — survives), with the detail page layered on top when a
// game is selected. NavigationStack push/pop is not used: the AppKit-backed
// stack tears the root down on push, which makes a true zoom impossible on
// macOS (`NavigationTransition.zoom` is iOS-only).
//
// Every per-frame effect is a compositing op (transform, opacity, clip) —
// no layout ever depends on `progress`, so the heavy page and root are laid
// out exactly once per flight.
